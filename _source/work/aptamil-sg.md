When Aptamil Singapore (AptaAdvantage) called for a branding campaign that would highlight *Aptamil Immuno-Nutrients,* it was answered with a complete rollout that stands out from its competitors.

Getting the message of nutrition and immunity across was a matter of using local humour and getting parents engaged with what they prioritize the most: *Keeping their children safe, healthy, and happy.*

The results from the campaign were repurposed for social posts and ads, as answers from the poll made for great parenting insights that served beneficial for both audiences and brand.
